# CosmWasm CTF 

CosmWasm CTF (or `CW-CTF` for short) is a repository that consists of intentionally written vulnerable CosmWasm smart contracts. You can think of this as a CosmWasm version of [OpenZeppelin Ethernaut](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/ethernaut) challenge. While the challenges here will be as native CosmWasm as possible (*i.e.*, bugs that would only appear in the CW environment), it would be interesting to add other challenges that work across different blockchain environments such as Solidity or Solana ecosystems.

Please do not use this in production.
